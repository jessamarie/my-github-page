      Welcome!

    <div class="h5"> Hi! I'm Jessica Marie. I'm a college student at Rensselaer Polytechnic
    Institute in Troy, NY. I discovered a love for coding in community college
    when I came across a Java tutorial on the internet and, well,
    the rest is history. I enjoy finding
    new ways to code and new languages to develop with. I am currently
    investigating opportunites in the vast field of Computer Science.
    My current interests are in IT and Full-Stack Development.
